# 🌀 TARDIS (Time And Relative Dimensions In Sass)

*"It's bigger on the inside!"* - The Doctor

A time-traveling web project that's been modernized for 2025. This TARDIS has been upgraded from Ruby Compass to Dart Sass and now uses Vite for lightning-fast time vortex navigation (also known as live reloading).

## 🚀 Sonic Screwdriver Installation

Before you can pilot this TARDIS, you'll need to install the temporal dependencies:

```bash
# Clone this time machine
git clone https://github.com/zkm/tardis.git
cd tardis

# Activate the sonic screwdriver (install dependencies)
npm install
```

## 🎯 Operating the TARDIS

```bash
# Start the time vortex (development server with live reload)
npm start

# Regenerate the CSS (compile Sass to CSS)
npm run build-css

# Run diagnostics on the temporal flux capacitor
npm audit
```

The TARDIS will materialize at `http://localhost:5173` and automatically refresh when you make changes to the timeline.

## 🔧 Time Lord Contributing Guidelines

1. **Regenerate** the repository (fork it)
2. **Open a time rift** (create a feature branch): `git checkout -b new-timeline`
3. **Rewrite history** (make your changes)
4. **Stabilize the timeline** (test your changes)

Remember: "We're all stories in the end. Just make it a good one, eh?" - The Doctor

## 🌌 Temporal Mechanics

This TARDIS runs on:
- **Sass**: For styling across time and space
- **Vite**: For rapid temporal displacement (fast builds)
- **HTML5**: The universal language of the cosmos
- **CSS3**: Making things beautiful in all 14 dimensions
